# Gmail Junk Cleaner

This script automatically connects to a Gmail IMAP account, searches for unwanted emails, and deletes them from the Spam folder. The criteria for unwanted emails include specific keywords and the senderâ€™s email address. The script is designed to run periodically, checking for junk emails every hour.

## Features

* Connects to Gmail IMAP server using credentials.
* Deletes emails from the Spam folder based on predefined keywords and sender whitelist.
* Uses `schedule` to run the script every hour.
* Logs actions to a file (`junk_cleaner.log`).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Gmail account with IMAP enabled.
* App password if two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled for Gmail.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielmederos2424/junk_cleaner.git
   cd junk_cleaner
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the script with your Gmail credentials:

   * Open the script and set your Gmail username and app password in the script.

   ```python
   EMAIL = 'your-email@gmail.com'
   PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'  # App password if 2FA is enabled
   ```

4. Run the script manually or schedule it using `schedule` to run every hour.

   ```bash
   python junk_cleaner.py
   ```

## Running the Script in the Background

To keep the script running in the background on your Linux VPS, you have several options:

### Option 1: Using `screen` or `tmux`

You can use `screen` or `tmux` to run the script in the background.

1. Start a new `screen` session:

   ```bash
   screen -S junk_cleaner
   ```

2. Run your script inside the screen session:

   ```bash
   python junk_cleaner.py
   ```

3. Detach from the screen session (without stopping the script):

   Press `Ctrl + A` then `D`.

4. Reattach to the session later:

   ```bash
   screen -r junk_cleaner
   ```

### Option 2: Using `nohup`

You can run the script with `nohup` so it continues running even if you disconnect from your VPS.

```bash
nohup python junk_cleaner.py &
```

This will run the script in the background and store any output in a file called `nohup.out`.

### Option 3: Using `cron`

To run the script periodically using `cron`, follow these steps:

1. Open your crontab configuration:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add the following line to run your script every hour:

   ```bash
   0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script/junk_cleaner.py >> /path/to/your/logs/junk_cleaner.log 2>&1
   ```

   This will execute the script every hour and log the output to `junk_cleaner.log`.
